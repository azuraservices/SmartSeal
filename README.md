# SmartSeal - README.md

## Overview

**SmartSeal** is a web application built with Next.js and TypeScript that enables individuals and businesses to **create**, **digitally sign**, and **securely store** private contracts on the Polygon blockchain. The app offers an intuitive interface for crafting contracts using predefined templates or custom text, signing them digitally with biometric authentication compliant with eIDAS standards, and registering them immutably on the blockchain. Users can easily access and manage their contracts through a user-friendly dashboard.

## Features

- **Contract Creation**
  - **Predefined Templates**: Choose from templates for various agreement types (rental, loan, sale).
  - **Custom Contracts**: Use an advanced text editor to draft personalized contracts.
  - **AI Legal Assistant**: Receive suggestions and corrections to ensure legal validity.

- **Digital Signature**
  - **Biometric Authentication**: Sign contracts using fingerprint or facial recognition.
  - **eIDAS Compliance**: Meets European standards for advanced electronic signatures.

- **Blockchain Registration**
  - **Polygon Integration**: Secure and immutable contract registration on the Polygon blockchain.
  - **Contract Hashing**: Protect privacy by storing only the contract's hash on the blockchain.

- **Secure Storage**
  - **Off-Chain Storage**: Store complete contracts securely using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).
  - **Easy Access**: Access contracts via QR codes and a comprehensive user dashboard.

- **Automated Execution**
  - **Smart Contracts**: Implement automated conditions (e.g., payments upon clause fulfillment).
  - **Wallet Integration**: Manage payments through wallets like MetaMask.

- **Legal Validity**
  - **Multi-Jurisdictional Support**: Automatically adapt contracts to local regulations.
  - **Digital Notarization**: Optional notarization services for enhanced legal standing.

- **Dispute Management**
  - **Arbitration Platform**: Resolve disputes with certified neutral arbitrators.
  - **Violation Reporting**: Log and monitor contractual violations.

## Components

- **Contract Editor**: Advanced editor for drafting and customizing contracts with formatting tools.
- **AI Legal Assistant**: Provides real-time legal suggestions to enhance contract validity.
- **Signature Module**: Handles biometric authentication and digital signing processes.
- **Blockchain Interface**: Manages interactions with the Polygon blockchain for contract registration.
- **Storage Manager**: Oversees secure off-chain storage of contracts using IPFS.
- **User Dashboard**: Central hub for users to manage, access, and monitor their contracts.
- **Dispute Resolution System**: Facilitates arbitration and dispute management within the app.
